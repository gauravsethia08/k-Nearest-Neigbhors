# k-Nearest-Neigbhors
kNN is one of many supervised learning algorithms, used in data mining and machine learning. Its is classifier algorithm where the learning in based on how similar is a data from other. 
kNN can be used for both classification and regression predective problems.

# Pros 
1) No assumption about data - useful for non linear data.
2) Simple Algortihm
3) High Accuracy
4) Veratile

# Cons
1) Computationally expensive - because the algorithm stores all the training data.
2) High memory requirement.
3) Prediction stage might be slow
4) Doesnt works well with large number of features

# Required Libraries
1) sklearn
2) pandas
3) numpy
